## 1. What This Project Is

AquaSentinel 813 is an explainable, multi-hazard marine-intake intelligence system being developed for the Arab Youth Space Hackathon 2026 — Track 03: Water Security & Marine Environments.

Core product principle:

> AquaSentinel watches the sea before a threat reaches the intake.

Primary user:

> Desalination Plant Water Quality / Operations Manager.

Primary operational decision:

> Where and when should monitoring or field verification be prioritized?

The PoC currently focuses on:

- HAB / biological water anomaly as the primary hazard.
- Oil-slick candidate detection as the secondary hazard.

The product is decision support, not autonomous plant control.

## 2. Read These Files First

A new agent or developer should read these in order:

1. `AGENTS.md`
2. `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`
3. `docs/DECISIONS.md`
4. `docs/AquaSentinel_813_PRD_v1.0.md`
5. `.agent/PLANS.md` when available

These files together contain the project scope, scientific guardrails, architecture, completed work, and next steps.

Current project phase:

**Foundation complete → continuity complete → AS-101 complete and merged → AS-102 complete and merged → AS-103 next planned, NOT authorized and NOT started.**

Current implementation and next milestone:

- AS-101 — Sentinel-2 STAC Search was completed on `feature/as-101-sentinel2-stac` from base `51f4ede`. Implementation commit `41a0b0b`, documentation commit `b3f0e9f`, and the approved review fixes are merged into `main` via [PR #2](https://github.com/Omar-Aboulwafa/aquasentinel-813/pull/2) at merge commit `1b83a732155ee01c01b7d33cb50115725cfb08c3`.
- **97 tests passed**, Ruff passed, and `git diff --check` passed. A real CDSE query returned 44 scenes and every scene converted to valid provenance.
- See `docs/AS_101_STAC_SEARCH.md` for usage, semantics, and smoke-test evidence.
- AS-102 was explicitly authorized on 6 October 2026 and is **COMPLETE AND MERGED** through [PR #6](https://github.com/Omar-Aboulwafa/aquasentinel-813/pull/6). Implementation commit: `fe3d27046c40600010753957ee8921d57071ec48`. Merge commit: `627b6ae8a509509dbb2d5d43bbdc6d74e0ce2aac`, merged `2026-10-08T07:06:46Z` / `2026-10-08T11:06:46+04:00` Asia/Dubai. AS-103 is next planned but NOT authorized and NOT started. See §22 for usage and validation evidence.

## 4. Known Good Git State Before Continuity Setup

Known `main` merge commit before AS-000C work:

`db79260 merge: complete AS-003 provenance model`

Known feature commit for AS-003:

`e2baedc feat: add provenance tracking and lineage registry`

Known AS-002 merge commit:

`113ca44 merge: complete AS-002 configuration and AOI model`

Known AS-001 initial commit:

`f878acc chore: scaffold AquaSentinel 813 project`

Do not assume these remain the latest commits after this handoff file is merged. Always inspect Git.

---

## 5. Required Startup Checks

When resuming the project, run:

```text
git branch --show-current
git status
git log --oneline --graph --decorate -8
```

Then activate the Python environment:

```text
conda activate aquasentinel813
```

Then run:

```text
python --version
python -m pytest -v
python -m ruff check .
```

Expected Python major/minor:

`3.11`

At the completion of AS-003, the known test baseline was:

`17 passed`

and Ruff reported:

`All checks passed!`

A higher test count later is normal.

---

## 6. Office-PC Setup

Current office-PC project path:

`D:\aquasentinel-813`

Current Conda environment:

`aquasentinel813`

Personal GitHub account:

`Omar-Aboulwafa`

Personal GitHub SSH alias:

`github.com-omar-personal`

Expected origin:

`git@github.com-omar-personal:Omar-Aboulwafa/aquasentinel-813.git`

This machine also has company Git/GitHub usage.

Do not alter global Git identity or company SSH settings unless explicitly requested.

---

## 7. Personal-PC Setup Strategy

On the personal machine, use the same personal GitHub repository.

Recommended sequence:

1. Configure personal GitHub authentication.
2. Clone the repository.
3. Create a Python 3.11 environment.
4. Install the project:

```text
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

5. Run:

```text
python -m pytest -v
python -m ruff check .
```

6. Continue from a task-specific branch.

Do not manually copy code folders between machines when Git can synchronize them.

---

## 8. Multi-Machine Working Rule

Before leaving one machine:

1. run tests,
2. run Ruff,
3. inspect `git status`,
4. commit meaningful work,
5. push.

On the next machine:

1. fetch/pull,
2. activate/recreate the environment,
3. install updated dependencies if needed,
4. run tests,
5. continue.

Do not move secrets through Git.

---

## 9. Scientific Guardrails

Preferred wording:

- HAB-like spectral anomaly.
- Elevated biological water-quality risk.
- Oil-slick candidate.
- Observational risk.
- Confidence.
- Field verification recommended.
- Monitoring priority.

Do not claim that satellite observations alone have:

- confirmed toxic algae,
- confirmed algal toxins,
- confirmed petroleum composition,
- certified water as safe or unsafe,
- justified autonomous plant shutdown.

The system supports earlier awareness and human verification.

---

## 10. Current Sensor Strategy

### Sentinel-2

Primary P0 source for:

- water colour,
- chlorophyll-related signals,
- red-edge features,
- biological/spectral anomaly detection,
- temporal monitoring.

### Sentinel-1 SAR

Primary P0 source for:

- surface-slick candidates,
- oil-related surface anomalies,
- cloud-independent marine observation.

### EnMAP / future hyperspectral data

P1 enhancement for:

- detailed spectral characterization,
- confidence enhancement,
- multispectral-vs-hyperspectral comparison.

Hyperspectral is not a P0 dependency.

---

## 11. Current Validation Strategy

### HAB / biological anomaly

Primary candidate:

**Al Raha Beach / Al Raha Bay, Abu Dhabi — April 2023**

Current validation AOI:

`data/aoi/demo_site.geojson`

Important:

- the AOI polygon is analyst-defined,
- it is not an official boundary,
- it is not a desalination intake.

### Oil

Primary candidate:

**Kharg Island / Persian Gulf — May 2026**

Historical reports and EO-derived evidence must remain clearly separated.

---

## 12. Current Architecture

Core reasoning chain:

Observation
→ Detection
→ Explanation
→ Exposure
→ Risk
→ Monitoring Priority
→ Human Decision

Existing implemented foundations (including AS-102 merged through PR #6):

### Configuration and AOI

`src/aquasentinel/config/`

Includes:

- configuration models,
- TOML loading,
- AOI GeoJSON loading,
- validation,
- runtime context.

### Provenance

`src/aquasentinel/provenance/`

Includes:

- source records,
- derived product records,
- JSON serialization,
- registry,
- lineage tracking,
- persistence.

Expected lineage:

Source observation
→ derived feature
→ hazard layer
→ risk product
→ operational alert

---

## 13. Configuration

Current default config:

`config/default.toml`

Current configuration includes:

- application metadata,
- AOI path,
- cache path,
- analysis date window,
- maximum cloud cover,
- risk bands,
- HAB PoC weights,
- oil PoC weights.

Risk weights are PoC hypotheses, not validated scientific constants.

---

## 14. What Not to Do

Do not:

- begin major refactors unrelated to the active task,
- develop directly on `main` unless explicitly approved,
- introduce large dependency stacks preemptively,
- commit `.env`,
- commit SSH keys,
- commit credentials,
- commit raw large EO scenes,
- claim confirmed toxic algae from satellite evidence,
- claim confirmed oil from a low-backscatter SAR feature alone,
- make hyperspectral data a hard dependency,
- average unrelated hazards into one scientific score,
- bypass provenance for convenience.

---

## 15. AS-101 Implementation and Next Engineering Task

AS-101 was explicitly authorized and is now complete and merged into `main` via PR #2 at merge commit `1b83a732155ee01c01b7d33cb50115725cfb08c3`. AS-102 was explicitly authorized on 6 October 2026 and is **COMPLETE AND MERGED** through [PR #6](https://github.com/Omar-Aboulwafa/aquasentinel-813/pull/6). Implementation commit: `fe3d27046c40600010753957ee8921d57071ec48`. Merge commit: `627b6ae8a509509dbb2d5d43bbdc6d74e0ce2aac`, merged `2026-10-08T07:06:46Z` / `2026-10-08T11:06:46+04:00` Asia/Dubai. AS-103 is next planned but NOT authorized and NOT started.

### AS-101 — Sentinel-2 STAC Search

Goal:

Given:

- configured AOI,
- configured date window,
- configured cloud-cover threshold,

return real Sentinel-2 observations suitable for downstream analysis.

Implemented AS-101 scope:

- use the explicitly selected CDSE default endpoint/provider, with configurable endpoint and collection,
- search by AOI,
- search by date interval,
- filter by cloud cover,
- deterministic result representation,
- map results into AquaSentinel provenance records,
- add tests.

Do not yet:

- download full imagery,
- run atmospheric correction,
- compute HAB indices,
- build ML risk models,
- build the dashboard.

---

## 16. First Codex Task — COMPLETED

The first Codex task was read-only and completed successfully on 2 October 2026 at `779069d`. Repository documentation, architecture, configuration/AOI, provenance, and tests were inspected, and Codex's understanding was verified without modifying repository files.

Read-only onboarding prompt reference:

```text
Read AGENTS.md, docs/PROJECT_STATE.md, docs/DECISIONS.md, docs/HANDOFF.md, and docs/AquaSentinel_813_PRD_v1.0.md.

Then inspect the repository structure, current Git branch/status, pyproject.toml, existing tests, config/AOI implementation, runtime context, and provenance implementation.

Do not modify any file.

Return:
1. your understanding of the product,
2. completed engineering milestones,
3. current architecture,
4. scientific guardrails,
5. current test/quality expectations,
6. what AS-101 should accomplish,
7. likely files/modules AS-101 should add or modify,
8. dependencies you think AS-101 actually needs,
9. any ambiguity, risk, or contradiction you detect.

Do not implement AS-101 yet.
```

Codex onboarding is complete. AS-000C.8 was completed by the separate explicit AS-101 development authorization on 2 October 2026.

---

## 17. AS-101 Codex Handoff Rule

Read-only onboarding was accepted, and AS-101 subsequently received explicit implementation authorization. Onboarding completion alone did not authorize code changes. Future milestones require separate authorization.

The AS-101 task should include:

- explicit acceptance criteria,
- a dedicated feature branch,
- test expectations,
- provenance integration,
- minimal dependencies,
- no full imagery processing.

Codex should report:

- files changed,
- dependency changes,
- tests added,
- test results,
- Ruff results,
- limitations,
- next recommended task.

---

## 18. Definition of a Healthy Handoff

A new agent/developer should be able to answer, without chat history:

- What is AquaSentinel?
- Who is the primary user?
- What decision does it support?
- Which hazards are P0?
- Which sensors serve which hazards?
- What scientific claims are prohibited?
- What has already been implemented?
- What is the known-good quality baseline?
- What is the next task?
- What must not be changed casually?

If those answers are unclear, repository documentation is incomplete.

---

## 19. Recovery From Context Loss

If a ChatGPT/Codex context window is lost:

1. reopen the repository,
2. read `AGENTS.md`,
3. read `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`,
4. read `docs/DECISIONS.md`,
5. read this file,
6. inspect Git history,
7. run tests/Ruff,
8. continue from the next incomplete task.

Do not recreate prior decisions from memory when repository documentation exists.

---

## 20. Human Owner Checkpoint

Before a major scope or architecture change, ask the project owner when the change affects:

- primary product positioning,
- hazard scope,
- scientific interpretation,
- validation strategy,
- dependency architecture,
- deadline-critical P0 functionality,
- external service/provider commitment,
- model claims,
- operational recommendations.

Small implementation details inside approved acceptance criteria do not require constant re-approval.

---

## 21. Final Handoff Summary

Current project phase:

**Foundation complete → continuity complete → AS-101 complete and merged → AS-102 complete and merged → AS-103 next planned, NOT authorized and NOT started.**

Immediate priority:

**AS-102 is closed. Prepare/define AS-103 only after separate explicit authorization. AS-103 is NOT authorized and NOT started.**

Core constraint:

**Protect scientific credibility and P0 delivery before sophistication.**


## 22. AS-102 Merged Implementation Handoff

AS-102 was explicitly authorized on 6 October 2026 and is **COMPLETE AND MERGED** through [PR #6](https://github.com/Omar-Aboulwafa/aquasentinel-813/pull/6). Implementation commit: `fe3d27046c40600010753957ee8921d57071ec48`. Merge commit: `627b6ae8a509509dbb2d5d43bbdc6d74e0ce2aac`, merged `2026-10-08T07:06:46Z` / `2026-10-08T11:06:46+04:00` Asia/Dubai. AS-103 is next planned but NOT authorized and NOT started.

- CDSE discovery is preserved; Planetary Computer supplies the actual raster product, with strict time/platform/tile/orbit matching and independent product provenance.
- Nine native reflectance bands plus SCL and product XML; XML-driven offsets/quantification, bounded COG reads, fixed 20 m EPSG:32640 AOI grid (310 × 228), bilinear reflectance/nearest SCL, and all-band conservative interpolation/water support.
- Fresh real acceptance began `2026-10-06T10:07:14.660936+00:00` / `2026-10-06T14:07:14.660936+04:00` Asia/Dubai. CDSE returned 44 candidates; known April 28 observation matched PC baseline 05.09 separately from CDSE 05.10.
- AOI 67,449 pixels; valid data 65,166; candidate water 10,211; retained valid water 7,963; AOI water fraction 0.11805957093507688 (11.805957%); water retention 0.7798452649103907 (77.984526%). Excluded candidate water: 2,248. These are mask outcomes, not confirmed water/HAB or aquatic suitability.
- AOI cache/checksum reload is equivalent and uses no network/signing/raster work when the cache ID is known. Runtime cache material remains ignored.
- Current final reviewed quality baseline: **265 tests passed**, Ruff passed, `git diff --check` passed. Six Rasterio deprecation warnings remain non-blocking. The historical 6 October implementation acceptance was **213 tests passed** (all prior 97 retained), with two transitive Affine warnings. Python 3.11.16 / NumPy 2.2.6 / Rasterio 1.4.3 / GDAL 3.9.3 in that cloud run. GitHub reported clean/mergeable before merge and no configured/reported CI/workflow checks; no GitHub CI pass is claimed.
- Decisions 039–045 record the newly authorized contract. EV-016/EV-017 and journal M15 preserve the 6 October implementation evidence; EV-018 and journal M16 record final review/merge. Historical EV-014 PENDING and later FG-01 PASS/READY plus EV-015 remain preserved.
- L2A BOA reflectance is not aquatic Rrs; coastal/turbid/mixed-water SCL errors remain. No indices, chlorophyll, HAB/toxin/water-safety/intake-risk or lead-time conclusions were computed.

### Resume/reproduce

Read `docs/AS_102_OPTICAL_PREPROCESSING.md` and `docs/evidence/AS_102_OPTICAL_PREPROCESSING_VALIDATION.md` before changing code. On this cloud checkout, use `source .venv/bin/activate` (Python 3.11); existing office/home Conda guidance above remains valid. Reinstall the updated project dependencies in the relevant Python 3.11 environment before testing on another machine; do not assume runtime caches are shared by Git.

Public entry point: `aquasentinel.preprocessing.optical.preprocess_optical_scene(context, candidate)`. The candidate comes from existing `search_sentinel2(context)`. Offline replay: `preprocess_optical_scene(context, known_cache_id=cache_id)` validates cache/AOI/grid and performs no external-data work. Canonical default cache ID from the real acceptance:

`0725a908d21cd655e83f70d2bb11247dc0f1516f0c00ea275efc3239113ee4a6`

Cache is local under `data/cache/as102/<cache_id>/`, containing AOI arrays and unsigned manifest/provenance. If absent, follow the documented strict live workflow; if corrupt, fail and investigate rather than silently reuse it. All water consumers must apply `valid_water_mask`; a finite band value alone is not eligibility. Zero retained water is a valid outcome. Captured presentation screenshots/maps and independent aquatic/HAB validation remain outstanding.
